title: Borders Exploration Group
---
<p>The Borders Exploration Group is a charity run by a group of <a href="/become-a-member/">volunteer adults</a> to assist in the physical, mental and spiritual development of young people through the challenges of expeditions - both <a href="/expeditions/">overseas</a> and at <a href="/local-events/">home</a>. Young people from the Scottish Borders are helped to develop communication skills and learn the value of working as a team. The Borders Exploration Group also aims to raise awareness of environmental concerns and to educate young people in understanding other cultures and peoples.</p>
<p>Borders Exploration Group's main activities are International and European <a href="/expeditions/">expeditions</a>, which take place (approximately) year about. Expeditions typically involve a community phase, an adventure phase, a project phase and an environmental phase. So far, International expeditions have gone to Lesotho, Ecuador, Kenya, Mongolia, India, Peru, Vietnam, Zambia, Chile, Cuba, Malawi and, most recently, Bolivia. European expeditions have gone to the Rhine Valley, Romania, the Pyrenees, Norway, Poland, Ukraine and, most recently, Austria.</p>
<p>All Borders Exploration Group expeditions are led by a team of volunteer leaders and BEG are always on the lookout for interested adults; if you are interested in getting involved please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> or come along to one of our <a href="/calendar/">events/meetings</a> - you will be made to feel very welcome.</p>
<p>As well as expeditions the Borders Exploration Group also run several <a href="/local-events/">local events</a> based in the UK including business and youth challenge days, Scottish expeditions, training days and members' events. Scottish expeditions have so far included trips to the Isle of Skye, the Isle of Rum and the West Coast of Scotland on a converted fishing trawler.</p>
