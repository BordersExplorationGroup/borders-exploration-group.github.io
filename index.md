Dear Members & Friends,
<br /><br />
I am writing to you today to make you aware that the current Borders Exploration Group committee has regrettably taken the decision to dissolve the organisation. This decision has not been taken lightly. We have been actively trying to recruit new committee members for 6 months with no success at all. The reality of the situation is that we cannot recruit enough willing volunteers to secure a successful future for the organisation. Over recent years the workload required of the committee has simply become untenable for a voluntary organisation and it is now only the larger groups and charities with dedicated employees which can realistically carry out all the necessary tasks expected of a group like ours.
<br /><br />
BEG has been an incredibly successful organisation, we want people to look back and celebrate everything it has given to the local community and all the countries we have successfully visited and helped in some capacity. We can take pride in what has been achieved in the name of Borders Exploration Group. We can look back on some 30 years of International Expeditions and the opportunities and experiences provided to the participants. We can remember the wide and varied list of projects undertaken, countries visited, communities supported, and friends made in the places we went to.
<br /><br />
The most important thing is that BEG is remembered for what it has given and although it is extremely sad that we cannot secure a future for the organisation nothing can take away from the opportunities, friendships and life changing experiences it has given. That is something very special and something to be extremely proud of and that should not be forgotten.
<br /><br />
With the above in mind I would like to extend an invitation to an EGM on Monday the 25th of March 2019 at 7.30pm at the Argus Centre in Selkirk. Where we can discuss the proposed dissolution of the organisation, vote on this matter and discuss the next steps after this.
<br /><br />
If you have any questions or would like to offer any thoughts please feel free to contact myself.
  <br /><br />
Best Regards,<br /><br />
Rachel Thomson<br /><br />
Chairperson

<p>The Borders Exploration Group is a charity run by a group of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/become-a-member/">volunteer adults</a> to assist in the physical, mental and spiritual development of young people through the challenges of expeditions - both <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/expeditions/">overseas</a> and at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/local-events/">home</a>. Young people from the Scottish Borders are helped to develop communication skills and learn the value of working as a team. The Borders Exploration Group also aims to raise awareness of environmental concerns and to educate young people in understanding other cultures and peoples.</p>
<p>Borders Exploration Group's main activities are International and European <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/expeditions/">expeditions</a>. Expeditions typically involve a community phase, an adventure phase, a project phase and an environmental phase. So far, International expeditions have gone to Lesotho, Ecuador, Kenya, Mongolia, India, Peru, Vietnam, Zambia, Chile, Cuba, Malawi and, most recently, Bolivia. European expeditions have gone to the Rhine Valley, Romania, the Pyrenees, Norway, Poland, Ukraine and, most recently, Austria.</p>
<p>All Borders Exploration Group expeditions are led by a team of volunteer leaders and BEG are always on the lookout for interested adults; if you are interested in getting involved please <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contact/">contact us</a> or come along to one of our events/meetings - you will be made to feel very welcome. Keep in touch by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BordersExplorationGroup/" target="_blank">following us on Facebook</a> or subscribing to our <a href="http://eepurl.com/dzV5mL" target="_blank">mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>As well as expeditions the Borders Exploration Group also run several <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/local-events/">local events</a> based in the UK including business and youth challenge days, Scottish expeditions, training days and members' events. Scottish expeditions have so far included trips to the Isle of Skye, the Isle of Rum and the West Coast of Scotland on a converted fishing trawler.</p>
