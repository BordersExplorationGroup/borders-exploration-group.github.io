<h3>Saturday 2nd July</h3>
<p>Leave at 10 am and travel via Callender through Glencoe, Kyle of Locahalsh<br />
to Skye. Set up camp at Slighahan.</p>
<h3>Sunday 3rd July</h3>
<p>Single track road further hampered by sheep with no<br />
road sense to<br />
Elgol. Set up camp overlooking beautiful, calm sea, over to Rhum with a<br />
spectacular mountain backdrop. Pleasant afternoon walk south along cliff<br />
edge to Prince Charlies Caves - lots of interesting plants and insects, fissures<br />
and rocky crags. Swim or paddle in Atlantic - bracing!</p>
<h3>Monday 4th July</h3>
<p>Hired motor boat and sailed up Loch Coruisk between all the seals. Landed<br />
at the head of the loch and walked overheadland. Spectacular scenery with<br />
shadows of Cuillins reflecting on water. Back to Elgot, on with rucsacs,<br />
off on the cliff / hill path to Carnasuary. Stayed in bothy. Weather turned<br />
dreich.</p>
<h3>Tuesday 5th July</h3>
<p>Full waterproofs for walk through hills to Slighahan. Weather steadily improved.<br />
Scenery amazing - light can change in a second giving a different atmosphere<br />
to the same scene.</p>
<h3>Wednesday 6th July</h3>
<p>Portree to re-stock food and a visit to the Airos Centre with audio presentation,<br />
of Skye views. After lunch it was on to the Old Man of Storr. Short climb<br />
to peculiar shaped rocks. It is like a lunar landscape. Set up camp at Staffin.<br />
Went to Floddigary, cliffs on one side, sea on other and on to Kilt Rock<br />
- so called because of the rock strata which resembles pleats of a kilt with<br />
the colours resembling tartan.</p>
<h3>Thursday 7th July</h3>
<p>Set off for the Quiraing, pausing only to take in the stunning views, climbed<br />
the Prison and Needle. Some climbed The Table which was not shown on the<br />
map. Navigation was from a 20 year memory. Steep scramble on very loose stones,<br />
through a chimney and dropped into hidden area - amazing rock stacks, spires<br />
and spurs all around. Back to campsite at Edinbane. In the evening a short<br />
walk to St Columbus Island and the graves of the Bishops of the Isle. Went<br />
looking for standing stones, some Pictish with Christian additions.</p>
<h3>Friday 8th July</h3>
<p>Rest day. Went to McDonalds monument and black house museum which is definitely<br />
recommended. Lunch by the sea at Uig before visiting a crofter's house at<br />
Skeabost to see spinning. Visited a craft shop before setting up camp at<br />
the head of Loch Dunvegan. Whiled the evening away in Dunvegan with beautiful<br />
sunsets over loch and Dunvegan Castle.</p>
<h3>Saturday 9th July</h3>
<p>Woke up to torrential rain but miraculously it cleared to let us climb Healabhal<br />
Mhor (the highest of McLeods Tables). Stunning panorama of the bays of this<br />
coastline and Outer Hebrides. Fairly steep climb in a strong/gale force wind.<br />
Rain on again<br />
- so back to camp. Visited Stein Inn - oldest in Skye - believe it! Sea was<br />
very rough with small boats being tossed about.</p>
<h3>Sunday 10th July</h3>
<p>Visited Piping museum and lace-making craft shop before heading for them<br />
mainland. Camped at Invercoe and walked down to Signal Rock which was a look-out<br />
post forinvading clans.</p>
<h3>Monday 11th July</h3>
<p>Headed for home by Glencoe, with mist rolling along and down hills. Amazingly<br />
the Anach Eagoch Ridge was clear. Stopped at Falls of Falloch for short walk<br />
- last one together for a while.</p>
