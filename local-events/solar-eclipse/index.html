title: Solar Eclipse 1999
---
<p>
Hard on the heels of the 1999 Mongolia Expedition, a group of 8 Adults<br />
/ Leaders from the Borders Exploration Group travelled to Strasbourg in France<br />
to see the 1999 Total Solar eclipse which happened on the 11th August.</p>
<p>
The original proposal was to travel to Cornwall to see the Eclipse from<br />
there as that is the only part of the UK which lies on the "path of totality",<br />
i.e. somewhere which will see a Total Eclipse where everything goes dark,<br />
rather than the Partial Eclipse visible through the rest of the U.K., where<br />
it stays light.</p>
<p>
The idea of France seemed a much better bet, with the reports of projected<br />
traffic chaos in Cornwall, so on the 8th of August 8 hardy souls met in Hawick<br />
and set off on the arduous first stage of our journey, a whole 2 hours to<br />
Newcastle to get the overnight ferry.</p>
<p>
The journey down through Belgium, Holland and Germany to our campsite<br />
was realtively straight forward and we eventually crossed the border, south<br />
of Strasbourg to camp in the little village of in France.</p>
<p>
The next day was spent prospecting the surrounding area and Jim making<br />
a cardboard box eclipse viewer (Blue Peter special design). We visited<br />
Strasbourg, definitely in Tourist mode and then went on a tour through some<br />
of the Black Forest, and "yes" the gateau is superb.</p>
<p>
Next day, head up the Rhine to a spot which had been identified as a<br />
likely spot to see the Eclipse from. With Alastair navigating, we headed<br />
north, in among a huge contingent of Swiss also headed up the same motorway,<br />
also to view the Eclipse. Would we end up viewing the Eclipse from the middle<br />
of a German Autobahn, in the middle of a Swiss Jam.</p>
<p>
Past Strasbourg, the traffic cleared, maybe they were actually going<br />
to work, and we found our way to the banks of the Rhine. and settled down<br />
to breakfast and to wait for the Moon to catch up with the Sun.</p>
<p>
The Eclipse was everything we hoped it would be. We watched the Sun<br />
gradually get eaten away. It got colder, the lights came on on the factories<br />
on the French side of the Rhine, the birds went quiet, and then it happened.<br />
It went dark, people around us gasped and cheered, it was a strange darkness,<br />
I still had a shadow and could also see colours, but it was dark, this just<br />
was not right. We had just over two minutes of totality, then the Sun reappeared<br />
to cheers from the crowds all up and down the bank. What affect did it have<br />
on us?, we promptly dug out a newspaper article and started working out where<br />
we could go to see another one, it had that kind of affect on you.</p>
