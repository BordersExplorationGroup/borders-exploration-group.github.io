<h2>Team Challenge Days</h2>
<p><strong>The Kirsty MacAskill Trophy</strong></p>
<p>The Kirsty MacAskill Trophy is competed for by school teams from the 9 secondary schools in the Scottish Borders. As with all BEG events, the Kirsty MacAskill challenge is a mix of physically and mentally challenging events which also tests teamwork, communication and cooperation. The trophy is named after Kirsty MacAskill, deputy leader of the 1995 expedition to Ecuador. Kirsty was tragically killed in a road accident less than a month after returning home.</p>
<p><strong>In Memory of Kirsty J. MacAskill<br />
