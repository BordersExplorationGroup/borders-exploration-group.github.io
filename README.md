# borders-exploration-group.github.io
The website for Borders Exploration Group.

Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme with the additional navigation hack from [Kasper Isager](https://gist.github.com/kasperisager/9416313).

The current list of planned improvements for this site:
* Change navigation from absolute positions to relative (to remove forced top spacing)
