# Borders Exploration Group

The [Borders Exploration Group website](https://www.borders-exploration-group.org.uk/) is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme (with the additional navigation hack from [Kasper Isager](https://gist.github.com/kasperisager/9416313)).

Planned improvements for this site:
* Rewrite homepage text
* Broken link check - SF
* Delete Flickr and move all images to GitHub with a slideshow then delete Flickr - SF for Flickr URLs

Blocked:
* After final event in 2019 - deletion of Mailchimp account
* Deletion of https://www.borders-exploration-group.org.uk/ domain name by 2020-08-25

Won't do:
* Change navigation from absolute positions to relative (to remove forced top spacing)
