# Borders Exploration Group

The [Borders Exploration Group website](https://www.borders-exploration-group.org.uk/) is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme (with the additional navigation hack from [Kasper Isager](https://gist.github.com/kasperisager/9416313)).

Planned improvements for this site:
* After final event in 2019 - deletion of Mailchimp account
