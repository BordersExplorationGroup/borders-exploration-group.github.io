# Borders Exploration Group

The [Borders Exploration Group website](https://www.borders-exploration-group.org.uk/) is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme (with the additional navigation hack from [Kasper Isager](https://gist.github.com/kasperisager/9416313)).

Planned improvements for this site:
* Tidy every page (to do: expeditions, events, resources)
* Replace site base URL
* Set up email redirects at 1&1 (website@ and enquiries@)
* Change DNS to create custom domain
* Verify WMT
* Clear out unlinked files
* Delete old site and cancel hosting
* Change navigation from absolute positions to relative (to remove forced top spacing)
