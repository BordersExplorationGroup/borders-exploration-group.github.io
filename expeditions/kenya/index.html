<p>The 1997 expedition saw twenty six Venturers and Leaders set off for<br />
Nairobi, via Edinburgh and Amsterdam in July of 1997.</p>
<p>They spent the first 12 days in Kenya helping to build a Community Nursery<br />
School in the Community of Kiawaithanji close to the town of Nyeri (burial<br />
place of Lord Baden Powell).</p>
<p>They followed this up by the Adventure phase, an ascent of Mt Kenya,<br />
taking 5 days on that phase of the expedition with 19 of the group reaching<br />
Pt Lenana at a height of 4895 metres.</p>
<p>The final phase saw the group White Water rafting, visiting a Game Park,<br />
exploring Lava Tubes and climbing Mt Suswa in the Great Rift Valley before<br />
a return visit to Kiawaithanji for the official opening of the new "Nan Lyle<br />
Academy".</p>
<h3>Foundations</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.borders-exploration-group.org.uk/images/kia2.jpg"></p>
<p>Work at this stage consisted mainly of mixing mortar; we did the mixing<br />
and our Kenyan hosts did the tricky work of positioning the blocks.</p>
<p>Work went fairly quickly at this stage, with two or three rows of bricks layed in one<br />
day. The other main task consisted of shifting the blocks from where they<br />
had been dumped, to lay them around the outside of the site so they were<br />
handy for the builders.</p>
<p>Work carried on at a steady pace, though as we got higher, we couldn't<br />
do quite so many rows in a day. Also we needed scaffolding, that was easy, just<br />
cut down a nearby tree, trim it and use the trunk and branches for scaffolding.<br />
As time went on, we were also allowed to get involved in the skilled job<br />
of pointing.</p>
<h3>Window Level</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.borders-exploration-group.org.uk/images/kia3.jpg"></p>
<p>Work continues at a fairly leisurely pace on the building as it got<br />
higher.</p>
<p>This photo shows the pace of work, slowing because of the height and<br />
our confidence (or lack of confidence) in the Scaffolding. "Need more scaffolding" ... just cut some<br />
more trees down!!</p>
<p>Still, as well as shifting blocks and mixing mortar, we were now allowed<br />
to carry out the skilled task of pointing, to make the internal walls<br />
smoother.</p>
<h3>The Lintel</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.borders-exploration-group.org.uk/images/kia1.jpg"></p>
<p>Our work at Kiawaithanji finished when the building reached the level<br />
of the window Lintel.</p>
<p>We headed off to torture ourselves climbing Mt Kenya, while the locals<br />
got on with the business of finishing their new school building without us<br />
getting in the way.</p>
<p>Kenyan Lintels were very different from what we expected, they go all<br />
the way round the building and tie it all together. What had seemed to us a pretty<br />
dodgy structure until then all of a sudden became quite a solid building.</p>
<h3>The Opening</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.borders-exploration-group.org.uk/images/opening.jpg" width="50%" height="50%"></p>
<p>We returned to Kiawaithanji two weeks later for the official opening<br />
of the new school building.</p>
<p>It really was quite an emotional moment for all of us to return to<br />
Kiawaithanji after a fortnight, firstly for the resounding welcome which we received from<br />
the community. The real delight for us, however, was to see a completed school building.</p>
<p>Then we went through a grand opening ceremony, to find out at the finish<br />
of it all that the locals had decided to name the school after Nan Lyle,<br />
one of our leaders.</p>
<p>So we now claim that our Nan is on a par with George Watson, Mary Erskine<br />
and anyone else who has ever had a school named after them.</p>
<p><P>( p.s. Cucu means "granny". )</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Our last week in Kenya was spent in a kind of "Wind Down", visiting a game park and White Water Rafting". The links below show some photos from The white water rafting. Enjoy the experience, we did!!</p>

<h3>Kenya - Summer 2001 - The return</h3>
<p>Five Venturers set off for Kenya in July 2001 on holiday. They were Jim McPherson, Nan Lyle,<br />
Pat Sutherland, Callum Sutherland and Ron Sutherland. The route was the same as the 1997<br />
Expedition; Borders &endash; Edinburgh &endash; Amsterdam/Schipol &endash; Nairobi. Amazingly at Amsterdam as in<br />
 '97, the plane moved away from the terminal and returned again with a "technical" fault, a very<br />
 scary coincidence.</p>
<p>This time the emphasis of the trip was very definitely on the holiday but we<br />
were to visit Kiawaithanji to see the progress of the school.</p>
<p>Arriving on the Sunday we decided to make straight for the city to see what<br />
it was like now. It was to be a little bit of a shock. We were told in no uncertain terms to get off all<br />
our valuables and baseball caps because they would be stolen. We were warned off some areas<br />
because we would be mugged if we went down that road. It was a much more scary experience<br />
than our last visit. Perhaps going on a Sunday was a bad idea because we were not hidden in the<br />
crowds. We did not spend long there but sheltered in the restaurant at the side of the Stanley Hotel.<br />
It had nice coffee and excellent pizzas on view.</p>
<p>Next day it was off to Naivasha. On the way we mentioned to our driver<br />
that we wanted to see the flamingos there. But there are none there he said. Long pause... I can<br />
offer you a trip for 5000 shillings each!!!! So to Lake Elmenteita we went. At this spot we were<br />
able to see about 5million flamingos. Amazing sight. There were also some sea eagles. They<br />
eat the flamingos. </p>
<p>At Lake Naivasha we went on the sunset cruise and were treated to loads of hippos showing off<br />
their dental configuration. There were also a huge variety of birds, ranging from pied kingfishers and<br />
sea eagles to splendid starlings.</p>
<p>The next morning we were up bright and early for our 6 hour transfer to the Maasai Mara. We<br />
broke our journey at a place called Narok, where we stopped at a petrol station and took on<br />
some refreshment of our own. Shortly after commencing the journey we were warned by Jonah,<br />
our driver that the roads were about to get a little rougher. Pat declared that they could not be any<br />
worse than the potholes we had experienced earlier. Famous last swords!! We were thoroughly<br />
shoogled, bumped, banged and thumped all the way to the gates of Keekorok Lodge, our final<br />
stopping place in the Mara.</p>
<p>The next two days were spent driving around the National Park viewing a wonderful variety of<br />
wildlife. The highlights of this were seeing a black rhino (one of 29 left in the area), a lion eating<br />
a newly killed wildebeest, another lion killing a newborn hartebeest and last but not least, driving<br />
alongside the migration of the wildebeest. What a spectacle the migration is. I can still hear the<br />
noise, the smell and the unbelievable number of animals in a never-ending stream coming across<br />
the plains from Tanzania.</p>

<TR ><TD COLSPAN = 3><br />
Another early game drive; highlight of which was changing the bus tyre with 3 lions some 200m away. Who was the "brave soul"<br />
who offered to keep watch on the lions from the top of the bus, while others changed the wheel. Back for breakfast. then on to Sagana</p>
<p><TR><TD>  28 July 1997   <TD> Monday    <TD>    White water rafting<br />
<TR ><TD COLSPAN = 3>After a relatively luxurious night in a bunk house; its off to go White Water rafting. The safety briefing on Crocs and snakes<br />
rather concentrated the minds on the task ahead. The rafting was truly memorable hard work and exhilirating rapids. All went well until about a mile<br />
from the finish - the waterfall jump - about 8m - OK if you don't go for the parachutist's "free fall" position as one venturer did.</p>
<p><TR><TD>   29 July 1997  <TD>   Tuesday  <TD>    Suzie's leap</p>
<p><TR ><TD COLSPAN = 3><br />
Another day's rafting; miss out the flat stretch at the start; more surfing; hard work etc - but only one went for the waterfall jump this time.<br />
<TR><TD>   30 July 1997  <TD>    Wednesday <TD>    Drive in the dust<br />
<TR ><TD COLSPAN = 3><br />
Off to Mt Suswa; a long dusty drive, then head up a mountain - over bare rock - in the bus. Past Masai villages & cattle; camped high up the mountain.</p>
<p><TR><TD>   31 July 1997  <TD>  Thursday   <TD>    Mt Suswa</p>
<p><TR ><TD COLSPAN = 3><br />
An early start to climb Mt Suswa - everyone made this one; an easier climb, not such high altitude and lightly laden. Biggest problem were thorn bushes<br />
which left socks full of seeds & thorns. Also explored Lava tubes</p>
<p><TR><TD>   1 August 1997	  <TD>   Friday  <TD>    The Carnivore<br />
<TR ><TD COLSPAN = 3><br />
Breakfast - break camp, then off to Nairobi where we booked into the Silver Springs Hotel Luxury - a sit down lunch then off into central Nairobi<br />
to the city market - souvenir hunting time - haggling was the order of the day - some did better than others. Friday night - off to the Carnivore<br />
restaurant - not a place for the vegetarians; Hartebeeste; Eland and Ostrich are on the Menu - who said "the ostrich tasted foul"<br />
<TR><TD>  2 August 1997   <TD>   Saturday  <TD>    Return to Kiawaithanji</p>
<p><TR ><TD COLSPAN = 3><br />
Our last day in Kenya - a bus is booked to take us back to Kiawaithanji for the officail opening of the school. This bus has a seat for everybody!<br />
The last few miles are nerve racking, will the school be finished - a sight that will stay with me for ever is the last few yards into Kia and we are finally able to<br />
see a roof on the school - it is finished. A magnificent welcome back; a spectacular opening ceremony loads of photos; more address swapping;<br />
then back to Nairobi; a burger at "steers" then of to the Airport for the flight home.</p>
<p><TR><TD>   3 August  <TD> Sunday    <TD>Home Again<br />
<TR ><TD COLSPAN = 3>Nairobi - Amsterdam - Edinburgh - we arrived back to a waiting posse of parents, friends and BEG folk.<br />
The last lap home to the Borders was in sight - back to our comfortable existence. Our time in Kenya let us see a completely differnt style of living<br />
with very different priorities and values. Life for the participants in this expedition, would never be the same again.</p>
