title: Ecuador 1995
---
<p>Twenty-five Borderers set out for Quito, the Capital of Ecuador. Here they helped on a building scheme, digging foundations for some much needed flats for deproved families.</p>
<p>The group then travelled to the Andes, for their Adventure Phase, climbing up to 15,000 feet. Half the group then went pony trekking while the rest went mountain biking.</p>
<p>The project phase drew the whole group together in the magnificent Cloud Forest, where they undertook various studies, collecting samples, some of which are now on display at the Royal Botanical Gardens in Edinburgh and building or improving facilities for a new Agricultural Research Station. </p>
