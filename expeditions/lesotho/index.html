<p>
The highest country in the world was picked as the first destination<br />
of Borders Exploration Group and was an unrivalled success for seventeen<br />
Borderers.</p>
<p>The community phase was undertaken in<br />
Thaba Khuha<br />
a small village outside the capital, Maseru. Here the group picked up shovels<br />
and helped build a stretch of road, clearing and digging dhongas (ditches)<br />
and building small dams in these dhonghas. Our venturers and leaders worked<br />
alongside their Basutho hosts and stayed with them in hutted accommodation.<br />
The Basutho we were working with, were participants in the "Price Mahato<br />
Trust" an organisation similar to our own Duke of Edinburgh award scheme.</p>
<p>
Having teamed up with their appropriate Basutho host, each venturer<br />
then undertook an individual project/study phase eg. traditional medicine;<br />
comparative health studies, Veterinary work in Lesotho; local policing, local<br />
ceremonies and&nbsp;dental health.</p>
<p>
The adventure<br />
phase included the Basutho and split into two groups. One group went pony<br />
trekking through the beautiful Malutti Mountains, staying in small villages<br />
and sleeping on dust floors. The other group walked in the Malutti mountains<br />
and slept one night in a cave on a mountain peak.</p>
<p>
Two of the group left us to work on an archaelogical survey. The locals<br />
were as welcoming as everywhere else, they gave up their own rondival (round<br />
hut) for our venturers to stay in. In fact, they had cleaned them out thoroughly<br />
and especially laid fresh dung for them to be able to sleep comfortably!!</p>

<p>
The whole group joined up again to stay in a Children's village. In<br />
reality, an orphanage which<br />
is run like a<br />
small village with the children not only attending school but also running<br />
a small farm. The produce supplies the village, with the excess being sold<br />
in the market in Maseru. While there, we graded eggs, cleaned out pig sties,<br />
washed carrots etc.</p>
<p>
After being entertained at the British Embassy, the Scots said some<br />
very sad farewells to the Basutho and travelled into South Africa for a few<br />
days in the National parks, a swim in the Indian Ocean near Durban, visits<br />
to the Boer War sites and a gold mine.</p>
<p>
A hectic few days to round off an excellent Expedition to one of the<br />
most beutiful and friendly countries in the world.</p>
