<p>Sadly, due to insufficient expressions of interest from potential leaders, we have had to cancel the planned expedition to Malawi in 2019. Thanks to all those who have expressed an interest and to all those who have been involved in the preparation.</p>
<p>Graham Little (Interim Chair of Borders Exploration Group)</p>

The next BEG trip will be Malawi in 2019! This is a great opportunity to revisit a previous expedition destination and to build on many of the brilliant Malawi-Scotland partnerships that already exist. The trip will be for around 2 weeks and we're looking for a team of around 20 people to take part.</p>
