<h2>Adult Team Challenge Day</h2>
<h3>The Tower Trophy Challenge</h3>




<p>The Tower Trophy Challenge is held over a weekend on the Riddell Estate near Lilliesleaf, Melrose. It is an adventure / team building event for companies and groups based in and around the Borders. Previous entrants include Exacta Circuits, Local Media and others. The aim of the tasks, which could be described as a cross between the Krypton Factor and an SAS Assault Course, are hopefully set to challenge the mentally and physically fit. The challenges in the past
 have included raft building, river crossing, assault courses, cracking codes, shooting at targets, speed marching... and more activities aimed at
 getting the best from every member of the team, if not just getting them cold and wet!</p><br><br>
