<h2>Isle of Skye Expedition - 1994</h2>




<h3>Saturday 2nd July</h3>
<p>Leave at 10 am and travel via Callender through Glencoe, Kyle of Locahalsh
to Skye. Set up camp at Slighahan.</p>


<h3>Sunday 3rd July</h3>
<p>Single track road further hampered by sheep with no
road sense to
Elgol. Set up camp overlooking beautiful, calm sea, over to Rhum with a
spectacular mountain backdrop. Pleasant afternoon walk south along cliff
edge to Prince Charlies Caves - lots of interesting plants and insects, fissures
and rocky crags. Swim or paddle in Atlantic - bracing!</p>


<h3>Monday 4th July</h3>
<p>Hired motor boat and sailed up Loch Coruisk between all the seals. Landed
at the head of the loch and walked overheadland. Spectacular scenery with
shadows of Cuillins reflecting on water. Back to Elgot, on with rucsacs,
off on the cliff / hill path to Carnasuary. Stayed in bothy. Weather turned
dreich.</p>

<h3>Tuesday 5th July</h3>
<p>Full waterproofs for walk through hills to Slighahan. Weather steadily improved.
Scenery amazing - light can change in a second giving a different atmosphere
to the same scene.</p>

<h3>Wednesday 6th July</h3>
<p>Portree to re-stock food and a visit to the Airos Centre with audio presentation,
of Skye views. After lunch it was on to the Old Man of Storr. Short climb
to peculiar shaped rocks. It is like a lunar landscape. Set up camp at Staffin.
Went to Floddigary, cliffs on one side, sea on other and on to Kilt Rock
- so called because of the rock strata which resembles pleats of a kilt with
the colours resembling tartan.</p>

<h3>Thursday 7th July</h3>
<p>Set off for the Quiraing, pausing only to take in the stunning views, climbed
the Prison and Needle. Some climbed The Table which was not shown on the
map. Navigation was from a 20 year memory. Steep scramble on very loose stones,
through a chimney and dropped into hidden area - amazing rock stacks, spires
and spurs all around. Back to campsite at Edinbane. In the evening a short
walk to St Columbus Island and the graves of the Bishops of the Isle. Went
looking for standing stones, some Pictish with Christian additions.</p>


<h3>Friday 8th July</h3>
<p>Rest day. Went to McDonalds monument and black house museum which is definitely
recommended. Lunch by the sea at Uig before visiting a crofter's house at
Skeabost to see spinning. Visited a craft shop before setting up camp at
the head of Loch Dunvegan. Whiled the evening away in Dunvegan with beautiful
sunsets over loch and Dunvegan Castle.</p>

<h3>Saturday 9th July</h3>
<p>Woke up to torrential rain but miraculously it cleared to let us climb Healabhal
Mhor (the highest of McLeods Tables). Stunning panorama of the bays of this
coastline and Outer Hebrides. Fairly steep climb in a strong/gale force wind.
Rain on again
- so back to camp. Visited Stein Inn - oldest in Skye - believe it! Sea was
very rough with small boats being tossed about.</p>

<h3>Sunday 10th July</h3>
<p>Visited Piping museum and lace-making craft shop before heading for them
mainland. Camped at Invercoe and walked down to Signal Rock which was a look-out
post forinvading clans.</p>

<h3>Monday 11th July</h3>
<p>Headed for home by Glencoe, with mist rolling along and down hills. Amazingly
the Anach Eagoch Ridge was clear. Stopped at Falls of Falloch for short walk
- last one together for a while.</p>
