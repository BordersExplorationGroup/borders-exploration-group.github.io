<p>We also undertake several different types of Local Events based in the UK. Some Events are &quot;Challenges&quot;
for Individuals or Groups; Groups can be from Schools, Young People's Organisations or Businesses. We try to ensure
that as well as being &quot;challenging&quot;, their will be a need for a mix of physical and mental skills as
well as being great fun. This way, hopefully anyone will be able to take part.</P>
<P>Local Events include:-</P>
<P>
<ul>
		<li>Survival courses</li>
		<li>Leadership Training</li>
		<li>Activity weekends</li>
		<li>Activity Weeks</li>
		<li>School Challenge days</li>
		<li>Business Challenge Days</li>
		<li>Fund Raising Events</li>
		<li>European Expeditions</li>
		<li>Lectures</li>
		</ul>
		
<P>Where possible, a UK-based trip will be undertaken in the years between the
International Expeditions. </p>
<p>So far, these &quot;Local&quot; Expeditions have gone to:-</P>

<UL>
	<LI>The Isle of Skye</li>
	<LI>The West Coast on a converted fishing trawler.</li>
	<LI>Isle of Rum</li>
</UL>

<P>Lectures are organised by Borders Exploration Group on subjects such as winter
safety and mountain first aid. <BR>
Leaders are also supported financially to undertake training for outdoor activities and other expedition courses.</p>

<h2>Team Challenge Days</h2>
<p>The Kirsty MacAskill Trophy is competed for by school teams from the 9 Secondary Schools in the Scottish Borders.
As with all BEG events, the Kirsty MacAskill challenge is a mix of physically and mentally challenging events which also tests teamwork, communication and cooperation. The trophy is named after Kirsty MacAskill, deputy leader of the 1995 expedition to Ecuador. Kirsty was tragically killed in a road accident less than a month after returning home.</p>

<p><strong>In Memory of Kirsty J. MacAskill <br>April 1966 - August 1995</strong></p>
