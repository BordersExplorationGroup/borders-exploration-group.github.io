<h2>Member Events</h2>


<p>Every now and again, we organise a Residential Weekend 
for Leaders only, to allow Leaders to learn / improve / revise any of their skills in a more
relaxed situation, and to also just have a good sociable weekend.</p>
	
<p>Task one, to find the hall. We had been promised a fine hall
in the middle of Craik forest near Hawick. In the event, forestry work had altered the tracks shown on the map,
but eventually everyone found their way to the Hostel, a very fine building, 
in a brilliant setting, it had comfy beds, a 
proper kitchen and hot showers, far too much comfort for a normal 
training weekend, though just right for our purposes. We began with a discussion on our Emergency Procedure, which got
 quite intense at times, raising many of the issues and 
producing a number of worthwhile ideas. After that, some relaxing ice breakers, just to make sure they 
were suitable for use with Venturers on their Training Weekends!!! And so to bed, around 1:30am.</p>

<p>Saturday morning saw Alan Young at his happiest; making porridge, good & thick. After breakfast
casualty handling was the chosen topic, followed by Map Work and
"compassy things" (&#169; C Kitchener 2000), then literally tying ourselves in knots on rope skills.
A Barbecue and more Ice Breakers rounded of the Saturday, a very informative, pleasant and relaxing day.
Sunday morning, Jim McP's turn to make the porridge - slicy stuff!! good & really thick. Then on to a gentle walk in the 
surrounding forest, we thought. With the "youngsters" of the group, Clare & Kirsty leading we had
a much more energetic walk!! and covered more miles in a shorter time, much more satisfying than the
hoped for gentle stroll they told us!! </p>

<p>Clean up the Centre, re stock the wood pile, pack up and head for home. And so ended a very
enjoyable weekend for all who took part. Many thanks to Vicky for all her effort & determination 
in making it the success it was. Thanks also to all the Activity Leaders; when will the next one be?
because they're good.</p>
