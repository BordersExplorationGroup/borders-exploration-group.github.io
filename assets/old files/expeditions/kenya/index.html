<h2>Kenya 1997</h2>

<p>The 1997 expedition saw twenty six Venturers and Leaders set off for
Nairobi, via Edinburgh and Amsterdam in July of 1997.</p>

<p>They spent the first 12 days in Kenya helping to build a Community Nursery
School in the Community of Kiawaithanji close to the town of Nyeri (burial
place of Lord Baden Powell).</p>

<p>They followed this up by the Adventure phase, an ascent of Mt Kenya,
taking 5 days on that phase of the expedition with 19 of the group reaching
Pt Lenana at a height of 4895 metres.</p>

<p>The final phase saw the group White Water rafting, visiting a Game Park,
exploring Lava Tubes and climbing Mt Suswa in the Great Rift Valley before
a return visit to Kiawaithanji for the official opening of the new "Nan Lyle
Academy".</p>


<h3>Foundations</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.borders-exploration-group.org.uk/images/kia2.jpg"></p>



<p>Work at this stage consisted mainly of mixing mortar; we did the mixing
and our Kenyan hosts did the tricky work of positioning the blocks.</p>

<p>Work went fairly quickly at this stage, with two or three rows of bricks layed in one
day. The other main task consisted of shifting the blocks from where they
had been dumped, to lay them around the outside of the site so they were
handy for the builders.</p>

<p>Work carried on at a steady pace, though as we got higher, we couldn't
do quite so many rows in a day. Also we needed scaffolding, that was easy, just
cut down a nearby tree, trim it and use the trunk and branches for scaffolding.
As time went on, we were also allowed to get involved in the skilled job
of pointing.</p>



<h3>Window Level</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.borders-exploration-group.org.uk/images/kia3.jpg"></p>


<p>Work continues at a fairly leisurely pace on the building as it got
higher.</p>
<p>This photo shows the pace of work, slowing because of the height and
our confidence (or lack of confidence) in the Scaffolding. "Need more scaffolding" ... just cut some
more trees down!!</p>

<p>Still, as well as shifting blocks and mixing mortar, we were now allowed
to carry out the skilled task of pointing, to make the internal walls
smoother.</p>






<h3>The Lintel</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.borders-exploration-group.org.uk/images/kia1.jpg"></p>


<p>Our work at Kiawaithanji finished when the building reached the level
of the window Lintel.</p>

<p>We headed off to torture ourselves climbing Mt Kenya, while the locals
got on with the business of finishing their new school building without us
getting in the way.</p>

<p>Kenyan Lintels were very different from what we expected, they go all
the way round the building and tie it all together. What had seemed to us a pretty
dodgy structure until then all of a sudden became quite a solid building.</p>



<h3>The Opening</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.borders-exploration-group.org.uk/images/opening.jpg" width="50%" height="50%"></p>



<p>We returned to Kiawaithanji two weeks later for the official opening 
of the new school building.</p>

<p>It really was quite an emotional moment for all of us to return to
Kiawaithanji after a fortnight, firstly for the resounding welcome which we received from 
the community. The real delight for us, however, was to see a completed school building.</p>

<p>Then we went through a grand opening ceremony, to find out at the finish
of it all that the locals had decided to name the school after Nan Lyle,
one of our leaders.</p>

<p>So we now claim that our Nan is on a par with George Watson, Mary Erskine
and anyone else who has ever had a school named after them.</p>
<P>( p.s. Cucu means "granny". )</p>
<br><br>






<p>Our last week in Kenya was spent in a kind of "Wind Down", visiting a game park and White Water Rafting". The links below show some photos from The white water rafting. Enjoy the experience, we did!!</p>

<h3>Kenya - Summer 2001 - The return</h3>

<p>Five Venturers set off for Kenya in July 2001 on holiday. They were Jim McPherson, Nan Lyle, 
Pat Sutherland, Callum Sutherland and Ron Sutherland. The route was the same as the 1997 
Expedition; Borders &endash; Edinburgh &endash; Amsterdam/Schipol &endash; Nairobi. Amazingly at Amsterdam as in
 '97, the plane moved away from the terminal and returned again with a "technical" fault, a very
 scary coincidence.</p>
 
<p>This time the emphasis of the trip was very definitely on the holiday but we 
were to visit Kiawaithanji to see the progress of the school.</p>

<p>Arriving on the Sunday we decided to make straight for the city to see what 
it was like now. It was to be a little bit of a shock. We were told in no uncertain terms to get off all 
our valuables and baseball caps because they would be stolen. We were warned off some areas 
because we would be mugged if we went down that road. It was a much more scary experience 
than our last visit. Perhaps going on a Sunday was a bad idea because we were not hidden in the 
crowds. We did not spend long there but sheltered in the restaurant at the side of the Stanley Hotel. 
It had nice coffee and excellent pizzas on view.</p>

<p>Next day it was off to Naivasha. On the way we mentioned to our driver 
that we wanted to see the flamingos there. But there are none there he said. Long pause... I can 
offer you a trip for 5000 shillings each!!!! So to Lake Elmenteita we went. At this spot we were 
able to see about 5million flamingos. Amazing sight. There were also some sea eagles. They 
eat the flamingos. </p>

<p>At Lake Naivasha we went on the sunset cruise and were treated to loads of hippos showing off 
their dental configuration. There were also a huge variety of birds, ranging from pied kingfishers and 
sea eagles to splendid starlings.</p> 

<p>The next morning we were up bright and early for our 6 hour transfer to the Maasai Mara. We 
broke our journey at a place called Narok, where we stopped at a petrol station and took on 
some refreshment of our own. Shortly after commencing the journey we were warned by Jonah, 
our driver that the roads were about to get a little rougher. Pat declared that they could not be any 
worse than the potholes we had experienced earlier. Famous last swords!! We were thoroughly 
shoogled, bumped, banged and thumped all the way to the gates of Keekorok Lodge, our final 
stopping place in the Mara.</p>

<p>The next two days were spent driving around the National Park viewing a wonderful variety of 
wildlife. The highlights of this were seeing a black rhino (one of 29 left in the area), a lion eating 
a newly killed wildebeest, another lion killing a newborn hartebeest and last but not least, driving 
alongside the migration of the wildebeest. What a spectacle the migration is. I can still hear the 
noise, the smell and the unbelievable number of animals in a never-ending stream coming across 
the plains from Tanzania.</p>

<TR ><TD COLSPAN = 3>
Another day's rafting; miss out the flat stretch at the start; more surfing; hard work etc - but only one went for the waterfall jump this time.
<TR><TD>   30 July 1997  <TD>    Wednesday <TD>    Drive in the dust
<TR ><TD COLSPAN = 3>
Off to Mt Suswa; a long dusty drive, then head up a mountain - over bare rock - in the bus. Past Masai villages & cattle; camped high up the mountain.

<TR><TD>   31 July 1997  <TD>  Thursday   <TD>    Mt Suswa

<TR ><TD COLSPAN = 3>
An early start to climb Mt Suswa - everyone made this one; an easier climb, not such high altitude and lightly laden. Biggest problem were thorn bushes
which left socks full of seeds & thorns. Also explored Lava tubes

<TR><TD>   1 August 1997	  <TD>   Friday  <TD>    The Carnivore
<TR ><TD COLSPAN = 3>
Breakfast - break camp, then off to Nairobi where we booked into the Silver Springs Hotel Luxury - a sit down lunch then off into central Nairobi
to the city market - souvenir hunting time - haggling was the order of the day - some did better than others. Friday night - off to the Carnivore
restaurant - not a place for the vegetarians; Hartebeeste; Eland and Ostrich are on the Menu - who said "the ostrich tasted foul"
<TR><TD>  2 August 1997   <TD>   Saturday  <TD>    Return to Kiawaithanji

<TR ><TD COLSPAN = 3>
Our last day in Kenya - a bus is booked to take us back to Kiawaithanji for the officail opening of the school. This bus has a seat for everybody!
The last few miles are nerve racking, will the school be finished - a sight that will stay with me for ever is the last few yards into Kia and we are finally able to 
see a roof on the school - it is finished. A magnificent welcome back; a spectacular opening ceremony loads of photos; more address swapping;
then back to Nairobi; a burger at "steers" then of to the Airport for the flight home.

<TR><TD>   3 August  <TD> Sunday    <TD>Home Again    
<TR ><TD COLSPAN = 3>Nairobi - Amsterdam - Edinburgh - we arrived back to a waiting posse of parents, friends and BEG folk. 
The last lap home to the Borders was in sight - back to our comfortable existence. Our time in Kenya let us see a completely differnt style of living
with very different priorities and values. Life for the participants in this expedition, would never be the same again.
